 did this work? ??

 ## Description
 To start, I downloaded the inquirer package from npmjs.com.  I used inquirer to add questions that would be sent to the terminal.  These questions were made to collect information from the user.  The answers to all these questions would be used to create a readme.  I then wrote an init function which would start the program when a user types "node index" into the terminal.  After that, I wrote a "writefile" function which would write all the answers to a readme page.  I added a license svg image that would be added to the page after the "writefile" function is activated.
